# Joseph Moraru - Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for faster installs and better disk space efficiency.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed
- If you don't have pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm` or `volta install pnpm`

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Run the development server with **instant hot module replacement (HMR)**:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Vite provides lightning-fast HMR - changes to your code will appear immediately in the browser!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This builds the site and exports it to the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages deployment.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Preview your production build locally before deploying.
